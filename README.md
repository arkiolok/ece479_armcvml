DNN Acceleration with Arm CV/ML Library on Raspberry Pi

This project was the final lab project for the course ECE479: IoT and Cognitive Computing course in UIUC.

Me and my partner Berkay Şekeroğlu, chose the DNN Acceleration track on CPU platform.

We have used ARM CV and ML Library to accelerate DNN's on Raspberry Pi 4. We have tested on different models such as MobileNetV2, NasNetLarge and Xception.

Detailed results and methodology can be found in the report.
